# Weather-Forecaster

## Description
This challenge allowed me to integrate third-party APIs seamlessly, utilizing data already stored by other platforms. This approach enabled me to focus on optimizing my site's functionality and presentation, making the most of the available data. It was an engaging and enjoyable challenge!

## Installation
To run the project on your local machine:

Launch Visual Studio Code or your preferred editor.
Clone the project repository: https://github.com/Kowther7/Weather-Forecaster.git
Pull the latest changes from the 'main' branch.
Locate the index.html file.
Right-click the file and choose "Open in default browser."
This action should open a new window in your default browser displaying the project webpage.
Access the deployed project here: https://kowther7.github.io/Weather-Forecaster/ 

## Usage
Upon accessing the project (or opening the deployed version), you can search for cities and view their weather forecasts. The site displays today's weather and the forecast for the next five days. Previous searches are stored, preventing repeated API calls for the same city on the same date. If you search for a city but on a different date, a new API call will fetch updated weather information. Each action triggers a notification indicating the data source - API call, previously stored data, or any search errors.
